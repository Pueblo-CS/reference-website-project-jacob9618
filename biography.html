        <p class="bio">Taylor Swift was born on December 13, 1989. In her early life, she'd write poetry (and later became known for her songwriting) and soon learned to play guitar. She signed to Big Machine Records in 2005 and released her first six studio albums under that label: Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and reputation. She started out with country music and shifted genres to full pop in "1989." In these first six albums, she earned five number one singles. After those first six albums were "stolen," she switched to Republic Records. Under this label she released: Lover, folklore, evermore, Midnights, THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT, and her "Taylor's Versions." She went from pop to folk and back to pop again while rerecording her earlier albums to earn back her work. All while earning many, many accolades, titles and performing on the highest grossing tour in history, The Eras Tour.</p>
